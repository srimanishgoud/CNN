# CNN with varying convolutional layers  

 
## Comparison of performance and training time for varying number of convolutional layers for the CIFAR10 dataset. Make a slider that varies the number of conv layers followed by some dense layers  

**Dataset** : CIFAR10  
**Model** : CNN  

Details about each model, as well as comparision between all the models can we observered using the side bar. Each model here indicate model with a specific number of convolutional layers.  

The app contains a slider for adjusting the number of convolutional layers. The accuracy of train and test, number of parameters, training loss, and training time are displayed for the selected model. The model details are shown in the table.  

Plots for accuracy, loss, and times are plotted for all the models for comparision.  

> The models are pre-saved since they take time to load each time the slider is adjusted. The code for saving the models is in `models.py`
